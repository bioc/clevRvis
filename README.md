# clevRvis

clevRvis provides an extensive set of visualization techniques for clonal evolution. Three types of plots are available: 1) shark plots (basic trees, showing the phylogeny and optionally the cancer cell fraction CCF); 2) dolphin plots (advanced visualization, showing the phylogeny and the development of CCFs over time); 3) plaice plots (novel visualization, showing the phylogeny, the development of CCFs and the development of remaining healthy alleles, influenced by bi-allelic events, over time). Moreover, the tool provides algorithms for fully automatic interpolation of time points and estimation of therapy effect to approximate a tumor's development in the presence of few measured time points, as well as exploring alternative trees.
